# 👋 Hi, I’m Paolo Gio Espiritu (@pgEspiritu)

- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, Python programming, and IT support systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS Cloud Technologies through the AWS re/Start Program, and deepening my skills in Python, Excel automation, and data analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly open-source projects, cloud-based applications, and tech community initiatives.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a GCP Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE) certified and an AWS re/Start graduate who can speak fluent Cloud, automate with Python, tame data with SQL, build magic in Excel, and navigate Linux like a pro. Oh—and I’ve also juggled project management while keeping the tech vibes high. 😎☁️💻
